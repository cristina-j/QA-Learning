## Functional Testing

This is about making sure the software does what it’s supposed to do. It’s based on the requirements, and QA is checking whether the features actually work the way they should.

The importance of functional testing is to make sure the application or producs does what is expected of it according to the requirements of said application or product. 

### How to do functional testing: 
  - You first need to understand the requirements for functional testing
  - Understand what the input and outputs are for testing different parts of an application
  - Create and exectue test cases
  - And then compare what the expected and actual results were

## Different types of Functional Testing
  - **Unit Testing**: This type of testing test each feature of an application separately to verify that they work correctly. This is to make sure that each small part of an application works the way that is should without having to depend on the overall application.

       - Example: Testing each function of a calculator: addition, subtraction, multiplcation, and division
    
  - **Integration Testing**: This type of testing incorporates each isolated function and combine it to the rest of the applicaiton to make sure that each unit test works properly together with other functions of the application and discover any issues that my arise.
  - **System Testing**: This type of testing validates the entire integrated application end-to-end, from start to end. This makes sure that the applications runs properly without any issues.
  - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: This type of testing is like a final test that validates that application works properly. This testing is done in a real-world environment to make sure it is fully ready for deployment. This is the time where if any issues are caught, it is found and fixed before the application is released to the world.
  - **Regression Testing**: This type of testing is re-testing to make sure new changes didn't break old features of the application.
  - **Smoke Testing**: This type of testing focuses on the critical features **(main features)** to make sure they are tested, and it is most important they work properly.
  - **Sanity Testing**: This is a form of regression testing. It is a quick check to make sure a specific piece of functionality works after a small change or a bug fix. It’s not a full test of everything.
